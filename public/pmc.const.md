# 0. Preamble
We, the members of this club, find it self-evident that there is no preamble. In the formation of a just club, we find it necessary and sufficient to thank Reza for his continued support.

# 1. Name
The name of this organization shall consist of the word "The", followed immediately by a nonempty unordered subset of {"Pure Math", "Applied Math", "Combinatorics and Optimization"}, and terminated with the word "Club", or any sane abbreviation for the above, according to the whims of the executive officers (cf. 4).

# 2. Purpose
The purpose of the Pure Math Club is to serve and promote the interests of Pure Math, Applied Math, and Combinatorics and Optimization students by providing services and hosting academic and social events.

# 3. Membership
Membership to the Pure Math Club shall be open to all sentient beings who are social members of MathSoc. Membership shall be extended to beings once a membership fee, set by the executive officers (cf. 4), has been paid to and accepted by an executive officer. The membership lasts until the end of each term.

## 3.1. Duties
Members of the Pure Math Club shall endeavour to be nice (in general, and to other members in particular) and follow the Code of Conduct (cf.11).

## 3.2. Presidents for Life
Membership of Presidents, current or previous, cannot expire, even if they cease to be social members of MathSoc.

# 4. Executive Officers
This club shall be ruled by the executive officers in a proxioctumvirate (henceforth referred to as "the Octumvirate") consisting of:
* President
* Vice-President of Finance
* Secretary
* Vice-President of Pure Math
* Vice-President of Applied Math
* Vice-President of Combinatorics and Optimization
* Vice-President of Propaganda
* Vice-President of Pop

To ensure that the Octumvirate contains two distinct signing authorities, the President and Vice-President of Finance must not be the same person.

## 4.1. Duties of Executive Officers
All executive officers are required to uphold this constitution. Additionally, executive officers are expected to read and respond to emails (cf. 13) that concern their specific duties, which are outlined below.

### 4.1.1. Duties of the President
It is the duty of the President to uphold this constitution and support the Vice-President of Finance as a signing officer.

### 4.1.3 Duties of the Secretary
The Secretary shall be responsible for the upkeep of club spaces, including but not limited to the Club Office and Discord Server. This may include the cleanliness of the office, the library, and any Discord bots. The Secretary shall also assist the rest of the Octumvirate in coordination related to club events and operations.

### 4.1.4. Duties of the Vice-Presidents of Pure Math, Applied Math, and Combinatorics and Optimization
The Vice-Presidents of Pure Math, Applied Math, and Combinatorics and Optimization may collectively be known as the “Academic Vice-Presidents”. The Academic Vice-Presidents are responsible for academic events such as Prof Talks for each department they represent, and exam review sessions for introductory advanced courses related to their department. This includes scheduling, booking spaces, and record-keeping for their events.

The Academic Vice-Presidents are also obligated to relay concerns from undergraduate students of their respective departments to the appropriate authority.

### 4.1.4. Duties of the Vice-President of Pop
The Vice-President of Pop shall facilitate the purchase and transport of refreshments to be sold or distributed in the Club Office; moreover, they shall aid the other executive and subordinate officers in acquiring refreshments for events. Candidates for the Vice-President of Pop must demonstrate that they have the means to transport refreshments in such quantities as are required by the Club.

### 4.1.5. Duties of the Vice-President of Propaganda
The Vice-President of Propaganda is responsible for recruitment of new Club members and promotion of Club events. This includes management of the Club's online image (cf. 11.2, 13).

## 4.2. Powers of Executive Officers
During their tenure, the Octumvirate shall have absolute power over its operations and those of the PMC. The process of coming to a decision and the distribution of power among the members of the Octumvirate shall be determined by the Octumvirate in whatever way they see fit.

## 4.3. Selection of Executive Officers
The Octumvirate shall be elected at a disorganizational meeting at the beginning of each academic term. Selection shall be democratic unless decided otherwise by the membership.

## 4.4. Tenure
The Octumvirate shall hold their positions until the disorganizational meeting at the beginning of the subsequent term (cf. 3.2).

## 4.5. Incapacitation
In the event that an executive officer is unable to fulfill their duties due to incapacitation or resignation, the President shall appoint an individual to the vacant seat at their nearest convenience. If the seat of the President is vacant, the Vice-President of Finance may choose to immediately assume the presidency and appoint a new Vice-President of Finance who is not themselves; otherwise, or if the Vice-President of Finance is also incapacitated, the appointment of a new President shall be decided by a unanimous vote of the remaining Octumvirate. If all seats are vacant, then the Club is immediately dissolved (cf. 7).

# 5. Subordinate Officers
Subordinate officers may be appointed any time at the pleasure of the Octumvirate, to perform such duties as the Octumvirate sees fit. These appointments shall last until the deposement or other removal of the Octumvirate. 

## 5.1. Powers of Subordinate Officers
Subordinate officers shall have no powers or privileges other than those explicitly granted by the Octumvirate.

# 6. Amendments
Amendments to this document may be made by any majority of the Octumvirate containing at least three invididuals. By a majority, it is meant a majority of individuals, rather than of positions: the votes of beings who hold multiple positions in the Octumvirate are not double-counted. If the number of individuals in the Octumvirate is \\(2n+1\\) for some natural number \\(n\\), then a majority of individuals is at least \\(\\max\\{3, n+1\\}\\); if the number of individuals in the Octumvirate is \\(2n\\) for some natural number \\(n\\), then a majority of individuals is at least \\(\\max\\{3, n\\}\\) if the President is included in the majority or \\(\\max\\{3, n+1\\}\\) if the President is not included in the majority. Amendments may be made at any time and are neither obligated to be made in any structured fashion, nor required to preserve the content or spirit of any past version of the document.

# 7. Disbandment
In the event of the disbandment of the club, all assets of the club shall be transferred to the University of Waterloo Engineering Society, with the exception of any remaining debts, which shall be transferred to MathSoc.

# 8. Axiom of Choice
The PMC officially endorses the Axiom of Choice and all consequences thereof. Any member who does not accept said Axiom shall be scorned nicely by other members.

# 8. Banach-Tarski Paradox
The PMC officially endorses the Axiom of Choice and all consequences thereof. Any member who does not accept said Axiom shall be scorned nicely by other members.

# 9. MathSoc Conspiracy Against the Environment
The PMC is officially disgruntled at MathSoc for their Luddite demand that the November 2002 constitution be submitted on paper. It is resolved that we shall remain officially disgruntled until such time as MathSoc submits to the Octumvirate a 1500 to 2000 word essay on the topic, 'Why we are ashamed that our previous reluctance to accept an electronic copy of the PMC constitution is directly responsible for clearcutting in British Columbia.'

# 10. Club Office
The PMC officially recognizes the Pure Math Club Office (MC 3033) as a place of worship, of indeterminate religious affiliation. Every member is invited to make the customary pilgrimage to the Third Floor of the Mathematics and Computer Building at least once in their life, and observe the Sacred Blackboard during irregular service hours.

## 10.1. Door Code Distribution
The PMC considers it a basic sentient-being right to be denied the PMC office door code. All beings, members and non-members alike, may request the current door code from the Octumvirate, to be denied at the Octumvirate’s leisure.

## 10.2. Club Discord Server
The PMC officially recognizes the Pure Math Club Discord Server as a continuous extension of the Club Office.

# 11. Code of Conduct
Members shall be respectful to other members and Club spaces in their actions and speech, including following the Code of Conduct of MathSoc and the Harassment and Discrimination Policy of WUSA. Additionally, behaviour in club spaces may be subject to rules of those spaces.

## 11.1 Removal
Members of the Octumvirate may remove individuals from club spaces or events for unacceptable behaviour or for causing significant discomfort for other members. Removals may last for up to one week to allow the Octumvirate to come to a decision on further action, and members of the Octumvirate and relevant officers must be informed of the removal immediately, while taking care to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. MathSoc must also be notified of removals.

## 11.2 Bans
Upon agreement by 2/3 of the Octumvirate, an individual may be banned from club spaces and events for up to the remainder of the term. An individual may not be banned for more than one term for the same reason by unilateral decisions of the Octumvirate. Bans for more than a term must go through MathSoc’s Code of Conduct Procedure.

# 12. Emergency Powers Clause
In the event of an emergency which renders PMC unable to properly hold the termly disorganizational meeting, the Octumvirate may, with the consent of MathSoc Council, extend their tenure for an academic term. If after the additional term the emergency is not over, the Octumvirate may extend their tenure for another term by obtaining the consent of MathSoc Council once again, and may repeat this for as many terms as needed until the emergency is over. If MathSoc Council is unable to give the Octumvirate a decision, then the Octumvirate's terms may be extended until MathSoc Council makes a decision, and the Octumvirate shall badger MathSoc Council into giving a decision until MathSoc Council does so.

Furthermore, at the time of a term extension, any member of the Octumvirate who is unable or unwilling to continue with their term may end their term at that point, and the remaining Octumvirate members may appoint a replacement (cf. 4.5).

# 13. Online Communication
The PMC endorses the @uwpmclub Instagram account, the pmclub@gmail.com email address, the puremath.club website, and the Pure Math Club Discord server as official means of online communication.
