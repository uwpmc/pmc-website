# PMC&OC Weekend Update
## There's no such thing as adventure and romance, only trouble and desire.
Greetings, and welcome to the first PMC&OC Weekend Update of the term!

First off : this term's executive! We held elections at our first meeting last Thursday... and your Winter '93 Executive are :

PRESIDENT - Dean Gaudet (defeaning cheers and thundering applause)

VICE PRESIDENT - Andre Chang (deafening cheers and thundering applause)

SECRETARY - Amber O'Hearn (defeaning cheers and thundering applause)

TREASURER - Kevin Takahashi () (the sound of one hand clapping)

What are our plans for this term? The same as usual&mdash;lots of talks, sports, movies and fun!

We should be having 8 talks this term, with an emphasis on student talks... keep your eyes peeled for signs of further developments! The PMC&OC is a student chapter of the Mathematical Association of America... drop by the office for details! We also have a filing cabinet full of information on graduate studies. Again, drop by the office for details. Finally, we'll be getting T-shirts in the very near future... only we don't yet have anything brilliant to put on them! If YOU have a brilliant design, or are capable of coming up with one, then submit it to us here at the office A.S.A.P.!!!

Sports? The PMC&OC has co-rec volleyball, indoor soccer and broomball teams!! Schedules will be posted when available... drop by the office for details. We had our first volleyball game on Thursday, which was just tons'o'fun!! We also have a road hockey team, and we are preparing to kick some TSA butt... or any other butt, come to think of it. So here's an open challenge to any and all clubs : if you think you're touch enough to beat the mighty PMC&OC road hockey machine, stop by the club and we'll pencil you in!

Movies and fun? Well, movie nights to the Princess and/or some other theatre are always in the works... and I'll probably make another attempt to organize the PMC&OC Mother Of All Movie Marathons 72-Hour Non-Stop Movie Weekend!!!! Who knows? Maybe this time it'll fly... And there's always lots of fun social stuff going on... from just hangin' out in the office (which, for some strange reason, is nowhere in the OED definition of fun...) to parties, to nights out at the Shelter or Fed. And don't forget our Humongous End-Of-Term Get-Together! Actually... it it should have thawed enough by then to have another End-Of-Term BBQ! One that will rival, or dare we say... surpass, the EOT BBQ we had in the summer! Mmmmmmm... barbecue!!!!!

If any of this sounds interesting, come on and drop by the office!! It's usually staffed with knowledgeable people most of the day almost every day. (formal office hours will be posted once we know what they are). We're in MC 3033 (right across from the Mac Lab)... x6139... or drop us a line... you can reach us at pmclub@watserv1.

Oh... and next week's column will be funny, too. Be seeing you!
