# PMC&OC Weekend Update
## Another math**NEWS**, another article.
The PMC&OC had its first talk of the term last Thursday. Danny Brown gave us an enjoyable, interesting and explicit talk about perimeters, areas and relatively anti-social activities towards jelly-filled doughnuts. We would like to thank Danny for his great talk. Up next? Thursday, Feb. 4... Colin Springer... talking about something interesting. Keep your eyes peeled for signs!!!

*Important and Serious Announcement:* On Tuesday, Feb. 2nd (That's next Tuesday!!), we are proud to present the PMC&OC's First Annual Mammothly Enormously Humongous Bake Sale To Not Only End All Bake Sales, But Also To Obliterate The Memory Of All Other Bake Sales Because This One Is Going To Be Just So Cool!!!! (a.k.a. The PMC&OC FAMEHBSTNOEABSBATOTMOAOBSBTOIGTBJSC!!!). "Cool!!! What can we do to help, Tak?" I hear you exclaim... (well, you can start by trying to convince my psychiatrist that enough is enough&mdash;10 years of electro-shock therapy has done all it's ever going to do for me...). Well, members should ALREADY be committed to helping out... if not, talk to the Grand Poobah (Dean Gaudet, our beloved Prez) or myself A.S.A.P.!!! All the rest of y'all&mdash;stop by on Tuesday and buy lots of baked goodies!!! We'll have tons of cookies and Rice Krispie squares, cake, brownies, muffins, and lots and lots more stuff!!! So come on out and buy, buy, buy!!! Remember&mdash;GREED IS GOOD.

PMC Sports Update!!! The turnout for our 2nd volleyball game was overwhelming! And to add icing to the cake, our High And Mighty Exalted Grand Poobah (i.e. our beloved President Dean Gaudet) showed up!!! We're 1-1 on the soccer front&mdash;after crushing some Engineers (7-1), we were served a cold double helping of defeat and injury in our second game... the details of that evening's events are too traumatic to recall. And to rub salt in the wound, we fared no better in our first broomball game... but fret not! The weekend's performance was merely a result of our being short on people. We'll still kick some TSA butt on Feb. 26&mdash;the PMC&OC Machine is unstoppable! Thanks to all those who came out to all our games!! And remember&mdash;we've always got games coming up... just stop by the office (MC 3033, x6139) and check out the schedule!

OR... check out all the PMC&OC happenings on our new newsgroup&mdash;UW.PMC!!! Not only the most important newsgroup created since, oh, last week... but ALSO the most important newsgroup in history to be called uw.pmc!!! Or just stop on by the office and visit! We're usually open most of the day most every day!

Well, I guess that's it for now. Until next issue, remember&mdash;mmmmm!!! Baked goodies! Mmmmm! Buy lots and lots of baked goodies!
