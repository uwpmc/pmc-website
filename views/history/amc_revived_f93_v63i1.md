# Applied Math Club Revived!
The UW Applied Math Club has been resurrected and is looking to be as strong as ever!

Over 200 AM students have supported the printing of an AM undergrad student class list. The class list will provide names, pictures, and phone numbers of AM students, and is designed to open the lines of communication between students in AM classes. Also, an AM Student Room will be assigned on the 3rd floor of MC shortly.

As well, the AMC had its first meeting Wednesday, September 15. Fifteen people, including Professor Tenti and Chairman Frank Goodman, attended to discuss future club plans. Class representatives wiill inform all AM classes about future meetings, seminars, and other activities in the upcoming days. Just attend class to hear about forthcoming club events!

If you would like more information about the club, its activities, the already-published newsletter, or if you would like to volunteer any time during the revived club's pivotal first term, please call Blair Nicolle or Blaine Campbell at 725-8857 (leave message if necessary), or get a hold of one of us by email: benicolle@descartes or becampbell@napier.
