# PMC&OC Weekend Update
## That's news to us
Welcome to this week's PMC&OC Weekend Update. As usual, we've had a number of talks since you last read this column. Prof Naomi Nishimura talked about parallel computation, Prof. Marston Conder about graph theory and group theory, and our very own Paul Check about Lie algebra! We'd like to thank our speakers for giving us such great talks! And keep your eyes peeled for the next talk - Prof Jeffrey Shallit talks about the Towers of Hanoi on Thursday, July 23!

Now, on to other matters... the Pterodactyls ended a successful co-rec slo-pitch season essential undefeated!! I'd like to take a moment to thank all of the Pterodactyls for coming out and, in some cases, enduring their pain! Our next target? THE PROFS!!! While the date has yet to be set, the Pterodactyls are set! We're ready! Oh, and should any other club want to be cannon fodder for the Pterodactyl machine... oops, I mean play us in softball, we'd be more than happy to oblige! The Wet Willies have also finished their co-rec volleyball season, and while turnout for our games was at times more than underwhelming, I'd like to thank everyone that came out - especially those that were at most of the games!

Hmm... let's see... what else is there to talk about? Well, social stuff is still happening - periodic BBQs have all been pretty cool. Time is running out quickly this term... and it looks like the mother of all movie marathons may not happen as originally planned... but we WILL be having a gigantic, huge, mother of all end-of-term-bashes... and perhaps we'll incorporate a movie night with the mother of all BBQs! Who knows? If you h ave a suggestion, drop by the office, MC 3033!

Well, that's about all that needs to be said... just keep your eyes peeled for signs about upcoming talks and other PMC&OC events! So, until next time, this is your secretary/treasurer saying... BORK BORK BORK!
