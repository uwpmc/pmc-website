## We're back!
## Hide your valuables.
Yes folks, we're up and running, and we've already had two events. We held the ever popular *Exotic coffee and Tea Party* early this term. We may throw a party jointly with another club near the end of term. Watch this space for details. Speaking of joint events, our first joint talk this term was co-sponsored with the (ooh) CSC and the (ahh) Pure Math Club. Waterloo professor Ed Vrscay talked for a bit about the Mandelbrot set as a dynamical system and showed some pretty pictures on video. Don't worry if you missed this talk, we plan to have several more blockbuster talks by cool profs on other neato applied math topics.

Drop by our office (MC 3031) if you'd like to help out or just say hi. We should have some hours posted on the door by next week saying when we're open.

##### **GRADUATE SCHOOL INFORMATION**

If you're thinking about graduate school, now's the time to start looking (if you're in your last year, that is). The AMClub has a library of graduate calendars from many schools in Canada, the US, and some school abroad. We also have information on the GRE, which you may have to write if you want to go state-side. So come talk to us anytime.
