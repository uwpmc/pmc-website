## The First of the Term, So I'm Told
Welcome back to our bi-weekly column in your friendly neighbourhood bi-weekly newspaper, *math***NEWS**. Wherein which we will wantonly update you with our regular club activities, and give up our ambitious attempt at alliteration.

We have, this term, a brand new executive, being the following: Leon Hsu as the all-encompassing president, Nikhil Shah as the all-supportive vice-president, and Eric Sutherland as the all-embezzling treasurer. M. Powojowski plays the official foreign head-hunter, Quebec division, F. Sinatra plays the doormat, the tunes are courtesy of Frederic C., and yours truly penned the lyrics. Soon to be released, etc., soundtrack available on etc., stuffed PMCOC dolls available by etc., etc.

Admission tickets are available at the box office, MC3033, and are good for one term. The cost? A mere one (1) dollar, payable upon receipt of tickets. Weekly talks have FREE admission, tickets are needed only for the privileged rights associated with the inner sanctum. They do, however, help to pay for the snacks provided at talks. Come by our (box) office any time, we're usually open during the day.

Now that that's settled, we can get on to upcoming events. Prof. Djokovic will have given a talk on Thursday on quadratic reciprocity and permutations. It was at 2:30 pm in MC5136. As usual, that doesn't do you a whole lot of good at this point, but I include it in the name of historical accuracy. Doughnuts and associated beverages provided FREE for all onlookers. Also coming up during the term are Maple talks. We will likely be continuing on our traditional frequency of one a week once the ball is fully rolling, and we'll keep you posted RIGHT HERE in this very newspaper. We have an (indoor) soccer team this term, to continue our long and mighty tradition of athletic challenges to any and all. We have already played one game, which I believe we won. Then again, I could be mistaken, if not outright lying, about the score. Oh all right, I have no clue as to the score, but the game DID happen, and my beliefs are as valid as anyone else's.
