They're out on the patio furniture looking at their Mickey Mouse watches and waiting for the eight chained orangutans. And on a completely unrelated note, the PMC has narrowly avoided becoming a Neo-Marxist Collective.

Our new god emperor, president and holder of absolute power is Chris Hendrie, supported by vice-president and source of absolute corruption, Kevin Hare. Rounding out our triumvirate is Mike Mosca, secretary, treasurer and keeper of the imperial regalia. Hail and congrats to our new leadership.

We'll once again be sending our finest to the field of honour, as PMC teams organized by Calvin Li (many thanks) will be competing in Broomball and Ultimate Frisbee. Come on out! Crush the enenmies of the revolution!

Keep your eyes open for more enlightening, illuminating and consciousness-expanding PMC talks on a variety of topics given by students and professors alike (any speakers are always welcome) featuring FREE pop and doughnuts. Also expect movie nights, social events and games of "Pass the Bengal Tiger."

Join the PMC. If you don't, you won't be a PMC member....
