## Party on Dudes
Yes folks, the AM Club continues to exist. Our first talk this term takes place next Tuesday, the 27th, in MC5158 at 2:30pm. Professor W. F. Ames, visiting from Georgia Tech., will be presenting an introductory talk on "Group Analysis of Differential Equations". As usual there will be free coffee and doughnuts (non-members, however, will be charged 25 cents for the styrofoam cups). Watch for our Summer BBQ sometime early in July and our End-of-Term Coffee and Tea party in late July.

As a reminder for those of you thinking about grad school, the AM Club has information on many schools in Canada, the US, and Europe. Drop by our office on the third floor if you'd like to peruse our files. If [SOMETHING] and we can arrange a time.
