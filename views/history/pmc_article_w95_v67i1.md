# PMC&OC Speaks!
## They can't pay us enough to stay away
We're back! It's another term and your friendly neighbourhood Pure Math and C&O Club is here again to bring you talks, sports, camaraderie, and exciting events!

The club executive elections were last week (What? You didn't see the posters?), and here are the results:

|**President**|Marni Mishna|
|---|---|
|**Vice-President**|Debra Richardson|
|**Treasurer**|Mike Mosca|

If you'd like to meet any of these exciting people, there's a good chance you'll find them in the club office: MC3033, just a short walk from the C&D. Or just come on down and see what the club is about; membershiips are available the club boasts a lending library with books on a wide variety of math-related subjects.

If you do come down, you'll also find the co-rec volleyball schedule posted conveniently on the door; our next game after you read this is Thursday, January 26th at PAC Court 1. Come out and support your club! (Andre, our ever-helpful co-rec sports organizer, is always eager to welcome new players.)

What else? Talks! We're still scheduling talks for the term, but our first currently scheduled talk (as I write this) is on January 26, when Professor Dickey will be our speaker. Watch for posters and check out the newsgroup `uw.pmc` for topics and more info (we may have more talks planned before then by the time this math**NEWS** comes out). And also watch for a PMC&OC bake sale sometime in February.

That's all for now!
