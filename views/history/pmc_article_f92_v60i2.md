# Pure Math, C&O and Applied Math Club Offerings
## Inane Ramblings of a Tired Man
You know, I think the Math Faculty could have another 100 terminals donated and I would still never be able to find a free, working terminal the night before an assignment is due. Bitter? Nah, not me.

Gee, great way to start things off, eh? If you bothered to read the title of this article, you'll see that we have annexed the AM Club. Since there is no oil in their office, we're not too worried about any U.S. Military intervention. Well, OK, we haven't actually annexed the AM Club, but being power hungry office-space mongers, we'd like to think we have. None of this is actually relevant, but hey, who's checking?

Turn out for Dr. Coxeter's lecture was phenomenal. Hopefully we'll have as many for Dr. Jerrold Marsden's lecture on Friday, October 23, at 3:30 somewhere. Look for the posters. This will be the second lecture in the "Mathematics: A Historical Perspective" lecture series. It will deal with Classical Mechanics.

Our Campus Rec teams are having good seasons, especially the Flag Football team, which is having its winningest season ever. Look out Golden Hawks, here we come!

We're still accepting new memberships, which are open to all undergrads, grad students and faculty. If you haven't paid your membership dues, your name will be sent to CSIS (twelve guys in Chevettes with Whisper 2000s). They probably have a file on you already. I can already see you trembling with fear. Seriously though, we operate on a tight budget and can use every dollar we can get.

There is a regular PMC&OC lecture coming up. Our esteemed VP has not given me more information, so just keep your eyes open for the posters.

Well, that's all for now. Hope to see you around the office sometime.
