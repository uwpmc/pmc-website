# PMC&OC Speaks!
Not much happening this week. Our second talk of the term was held on Thursday; Professor Bill Cunningham spoke on "Can the Blue Jays win the Pennant?", a discussion of how C&O relates to the pennant race. This article's actually being written on Monday, so I can't really tell you how it was, but hey, I plan to be there!

Seminars also started this week on Wiles' Proof and Fermat's Last Theorem. These seminars, organized by the Kolster-Murty-Snaith-Weiss group, are held every Tuesday at 4:30 in the Fields Institute. Check it out if you want all of the gory details about how Fermat's Last Theorem was finally proven!

And on the sports front, even as I type this article our valiant PMC&OC Flag Football team is (hopefully) winning another match. Our basketball team also had a match on Wednesday. Check out the door of the PMC&OC club for further details.

Well, I'm off... I'm going to a Putnam training session. If you want to write the Putnam but haven't signed up yet, talk to Dorothy Chapman in MC 5107 *real soon now*. Bye for now!
