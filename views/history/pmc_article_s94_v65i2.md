# PMC&OC Speaks!
## Off and Running
Well, it's the second column of the term! What have we done so far? Our first talk was held last week, on Projective Geometry, and it went rather well if I do say so myself. Of course, since I gave it I may be just a *little* bit biased, but no one threw tomatoes which I took to be a good sign. [*Have you seen the price of tomatoes, lately? -Fz*]

What else? Our slo-pitch baseball team is now happily playing games. Come on down to the office if you're interested. We particularly would like to see more female players come out and play. Our next scheduled talk (unless we find another one even sooner) is by Leon Tsu and wil happen sometime in mid-June, with the topic to be announced. In the meantime, the word "barbeque" has been tossed around the office a few times recently, so be on the lookout for one of those! If we can organize a barbeque, posters should appear in the next few weeks.

Ta-ta for now!
