# Terrorists Threaten the Pure Math and C&O Club!!
Yes, it's true. We have been receiving anonymous calls from the vicious, vagrant, villainous vermin who have violated the sanctity of our office and abducted the Precious Watermelon. They have made numerous unreasonable demands, which we will not comply with. We have taken a firm stance against terrorism and will make no concessions.

On October 21st, we had another talk in the "Mathematics: A Historical Perspective" series, from Dr. Jerrold Marsden. It was a great success, with over 150 in attendance. Next in the series is a talk by Dr. David Sprott, speaking on the History of Statistics on November 10th, at 1:30 in DC 1302. (Hey, wow! comfy chairs too!)

We had another talk, on October 28th, from Dr. Michael Bean, on Prime Numbers. Since this article is being written on Monday, I can only speculate on how good it was (will be?), but knowing Mike, I figure it was (will be?) a great lecture.

Our spectacular sports seasons have finally come to an end. Granted, we didn't win the World Series or anything like that, but we had our strongest finish ever in Flag Football, but lost to the 3rd place team in the finals. Our soccer team also lost in the finals, but it was really close. If only I had been there. Yeah, right.

Much has happened in The Office recently. In particular, a spectacular effort was put forth by Nikhil, Martian, Amber and Colin (in no particular order), who cleaned our office and re-arranged the furniture. There seems to be so much more space now. And, somehow, our couch looks bigger too. It's incredible what a little cleaning and re-arranging can do.

Here, at the PMC&OC, we feel that we are a distinct society, with a unique culture, language and civil law tradition. Thus, we consider ourselves a separate people from The Rest of Canada. In accordance with the United Nations, we feel, that as a people, we have a right to self-determination. Thus, on April 1, 1993, a referendum will be held among all PMC&OC members as to whether or not we should secede from The Rest of Canada. On April 1, 1993, exercise your franchise. It's you club, you make the decision.
