Blair Madore: CEO of PMC Board of Directors and a generally-omnipotent-being.
Autographs are available almost anytime during office hours.

- The faithful Pure Math Grapevine says that Prof. Ken Davidson will be giving some words of wisdom on some topic in the near future. These serious allegations are as yet unconfirmed. More to follow.
- High school students who will one day graduate and take their rightful place in the PM Club had fun at the Waterloo Seminars. Party, eh!
- Our PM volleyball and softball teams have remained undefeated this term! We don't keep score. We always win. We don't keep score. Don't ask. Talk to Captain Carmen, our leader.
