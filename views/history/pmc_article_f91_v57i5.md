## Secrets Revealed!!!
With midterms being very close to over, many of you who have not been able to make it to our talks might be interested in the upcoming ones. We next have Prof Dickey speaking to us on Algebraic Curves. This talk will be on Thursday, November 14th at noon in MC5158. Also, on Tuesday, November 19th we will have our friend Paul Check with a talk on the Feynman Integral. And on Thursday, November 21 Prof Heums, from Engineering, will be speaking.

I would like to thank both Ravi and Prof Wagner for the talks they gave us since our last issue. In conclusion, Ravi would have us believe that one could optimize the probability of ending up with the "perfect mate" if one was not to start dating before the age of 36, and not to marry before the age of 100. I think even the most avid of "Ravi followers" would have high hopes of Ravi's fallibility in this case. Wagner's talk entitled "A Taste of Algebraic Graph Theory" was very well received by all, and gave insight into the beautiful applications of ideas from the ever popular linear algebra.

As for other news, both of our foreentioned speakers should be commended on their courage in issuing challenges to certain PMCOC members. Prof Wagner befell an honourable defeat in Othello last week against our own Colin Springer. Also, it should be noted that defeat lumed over Ravi as well in a three game match of 8-ball with a certai unmentioned individual. Again, I commend these two for their actions of courage, and issue an open challenge to any and all other profs in the field of their choice (preferable not mathematical).

CHALLENGE!!! The ActSci Club has chellenged us to a volleyball game to be held in about two weeks time. We honourably accept said challenge, even though I've been advised that the motivating factor for this challenge is that they have seen our team play.

And finally, plans are underway for our second Undergraduate Math Day. This term, we will host the U oF T "MATH007" club for a day of student lectures and discussions. A signup sheet with further details will be available at our office for those interested. Everybody is welcome, and encouraged to consider taking part.
