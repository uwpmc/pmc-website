# Applied Math Club Seminars
With the encumberance of midterms now only a memory, the Applied Math Club is once again in high gear.

Yesterday the club organized two different seminars in two different buildings, (which in itself is impressive). Professor Lipschitz of the Applied Math Department spoke on compact disc technology, with emphasis on error correction theory and its use. This was followed by a seminar by professor J. Paldus on Group Representations and their Applications in the Physical Sciences.

On Thursday November 21, Dr. Peter Taylor, of the Atmospheric Environment Service will give a talk on applications of mathematics, entitled "A Little Mathematics Can Go A Long Way". Dr Taylor's talk will include illustrations of the uses of mathematics in oceanography and meteorology. His reputations promises an event which will be both interesting and entertaining for more than just Applied Mathematics students.

These events mark the last events of the term, but the club is already actively organizing for the Winter term. Memberships are always available and everyone is welcome to all club events.
