# PMC&OC Speaks!
## Mmmmm... Bake Sale!
Actually, this was a pretty slow week. We had a talk on Tuesday about "Solving Minimal Surface Equations using Complex Numbers," and next Wednesday we have another talk on "Two-person Game Theory and Computer Chicken" by Dr. Phillip Morenz. There will be a programming tournament open to Math undergrads concerning this subject; details will be announced at the talk. And yesterday our co-rec volleyball team had another match. What's that? You want to know how it came out? You mean you weren't there??

The really big news is what's happening two weeks from now... the always well anticipated PMC&OC Bake Sale!!! Yes, on November 15th your Pure Math and C&O Club will be selling scrum-dilly-icious homemade baked treats in the hallway outside the C&D As Tak would say: Mmmmm... baked goodies!! So come on down! And if you want to bake something, or help sell things on the 15th, talk to Lisa Kim (llkim@descartes) and she'll tell you all you need to know.

'Till next time,
