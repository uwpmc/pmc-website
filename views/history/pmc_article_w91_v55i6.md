Well, another term has come to an end. The last few weeks have been especially busy, so a recap of the term is definitely out of the question. Instead, I will give you some highlights of the last few weeks.

The Pure Math Club held High School Math Day on Friday, March 15th. About 35 students from 10 schools across the Kitchener-Waterloo region participated in lectures and problem solving. The day was a great success and was enjoyed by all. I would like to thank all those who helped out, but especially Blair Madore, Kirsten Nelson and Keith Orpen for the lectures they presented.

Also, I would like to thank Prof Katheryn Hare for speaking for us on "Wavelets", and Prof Ed Burger for his talk on "The Texas Cake Cutting Massacre".

On Friday, merch 22nd, the Pure Math Club and the U of T Math Club held a joint Undergrad Math Day at the University of Toronto. It was both enlightening and enjoyable to share problems, ideas and lectures with our U of T peers. I would like to thank those who participated. Special thanks goes to our drivers Dee vint and Paul Trudel.

Congratulations to all those who participated in our Co-Rec Indoor Soccer Team throughout the term. Once again, the Mathie Team Spirit shone through.

In closing, I would like to express my appreciation for all those who have helped to make this term a success. My thanks goes out to the profs for the wonderful lectures, all those who helped putting up posters, Harvey for writing our MathNews articles, MathSoc for their support and cooperation, and especially all of you who attended the lectures and participated in our events. Your interest and enthusiasm never fails us, and continues to be the reason we are here.
