## and bits and bits
Welcome to another installment of the continuing saaaga of the Pure Math Club. Here to keep you up to date on all the wondrous things happening this term.

First of all, our first talk which will be held next Thursday, October 4, went splendidly. Please note the change: talks are now held on Thursdays, at 3:30 PM, in MC 4063, NOT Wednesdays. Prof Baker spoke on winding numbers, and torii were displayed and adored in great abundance. All in all, it was a splendid start to the PMC talk season. Up next on the batting list is someone who is not yet known, talking on an as yet undetermined subject, on October 11. And Paul Check will be talking about his experience as a student in the *Budapest Semesters in Mathematics* the week after. We'll have information available on the program, for those of you who might be thinking of going yourself. Also, Toronto's Ravi Vakil will likely be giving a talk soon, so stay tuned.

We're collecting together information on scholarshiips and opportunities available in pure math; drop by and have a look. We've got a large collection of math and related books for browsing. Come by and take a look. And remember that memberships are only available until October 12. For a mere one dollar, you too can become a member of the illustrious PMC. If you've signed the door, that's great, but to become an official PMC member, you must purchase a membership card for one dollar from our office at MC 3033 during our hours: 1:30 - 2:30 weekdays. Remember also that only full (ie: paid up) members get a discount at the fabulous upcoming PMC pizza lunch. The tentative date of October 17 still holds. All your friends will be there, sporting their bright yellow PMC member cards (signed by the president) and their multi-colour PMC sports wear, casually tossing back another slice and a cold one [ed note: PMC beer budget still pending]: where will you be?

Further to our open challenge of last week: it has come to our attention that a senior executive member of the Applied Math Club will imminently throw down the gauntlet and face us in a game of GO. Unfortunately, we forgot our monopoly board at home. We're not afraid, though. We're not afraid of anything. We're far too stupid to be afraid of anything. But that's ok, we have a plan. First we will learn the rules of this noble game. Then, we will learn the winning strategy. Then we will win, thus justifying our previous bravado and general ranting and raving. (Don't tell the AMC, but if anyone has an understanding of the rules and/or guaranteed winning strategy for this game, we would appreciate you dropping by and illuminating us.) It's tactics like this that make the PMC what it is today.

It has also been brought to my attention that the CSC has challenged us to luge. Yes, that's right, luge. It seems that they have some experience in this sport. Says "bob", a high-ranking executive co-chair on the vice-president's sub-comittee on tea production, "every time the ol' sytek port goes down, i feel like upgrading our communication lines with an ax. But then I go out for a nice run or two on the ol' luge hill, and I feel so much better. Cures arthritis too!" So be it. We accept your challenge, you of the CSC, though we again suffer a handicap of ignorance. We remain confident of our ability to overcome any obstacle (as long as it isn't too taxing).
