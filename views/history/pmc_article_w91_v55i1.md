# Pure Math Club
It is a typical Wednesday night in the village. The last of the Bombshelter crowd is clambering in, bombed of course. I am lying in my bed. Tossing and turning, something is bothering me. Today I received a bizarre piece of email

"Tonight, you are the First."

It came from NAMABLAMAHAMA@WHATFOR. I tried to track this person down, but nobody semed to know Namablamahama. I roll over and look at the clock, 2:00am. But what's that? There is something moving in my room. With my well honed PMC stealth skills, I quickly and quietly get out of my bed and make my way to a lamp. Click! It's on, there is light, and an intruder in my room!

"Good evening, I warned you, You would be the first", The mysterious man in black announces. Suddenly, he pulls out a 1 meter sword, and slices at me! Panic races through my body, I dodge more stabs from this evil foe.

I shout "I'm warning you. I have the strength of ten men, My heart is PURE!" This doesn't bother him so I race for the door. But he is closer! Oh horrible day! He slices off my left arm!

Now you may think that I'm done for, with my sliceable left arm sliced off, but you're wrong. How do you know tthat you're wrong? I'm writing this column aren't I?

Blood is gushing out of my left stump. The stranger is rearing for another slice! I am going into shock, but then I remember. I am a member of the Pure Math Club. Those elite few who can stand calm in the face of danger, be strong when the evil is so thick you can smell it, fight until the battle is won. You too can be a member for $1.00. So I think, and ponder, and recall that the cookies I swiped from the village cafeteria are nearby. Silently, yet quickly I throw them at him. One bruise, two bruises! A burst eye! The intruder stumbles around and stabs randomly. Finally he makes it to the door and escaped into the cold night air.

Why didn't I follow my attacker? Because I sleep naked. In the summer I would have trailed him, but the winters are too much.

I cap my left arm up as good as I can, get dressed and make my way to my head quarters: The Pure Math Club in the hallway beside the Pink Tie Zone. Open week days from 1:30 to 2:30, and from 2:00am to 5:00am, if you know the secret password.

V9phystu@watdcs, my omnipotent, yet lovable leader is there.

"Good hevins! What happened to you!", she queries.

"I was attacked! By Namablamahama."

"You shouldn't have fought back, they only wanted to kidnap you."

"And how do you know that?"

"They kidnapped Ernie 0A!"

"Shades of Days of Thunder!"

"We think it has something to do with the talks the Pure Math Club held on the crisis in the Middle East last Tuesday."

"What's the plan?"

"You best be able to help us by recruiting more people, to better compliment our 70 members."

"Consider itdone. But what about Ernie 0A?"

"We'll just have to wait until we can find out more."

My job should be easy: only very boring souls could resist the adventure that the Pure Math Club brings. All I'd have to tell them is that they could sign up by going to room 3033. Office hours are daily from 1:30 to 2:30.

"Don't screw up, like the last recruiter did. He's been properly taken care of."

I remember the mistake. Our meeting was scheduled in the same room as a meeting of the Jewish Students Association. This was not realised until someone asked Dee if she was a convert.

As I headed home, Many questions ran through my mind. Was Paul's excellent talk on the Middle East tied to this? What would become of Ernie 0A, could we save him?

I'm shure our leader V9phystu@Watdcs will win.
