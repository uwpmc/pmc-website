# The PMC Speaks
Greetings from the Pure Math and Combinatorics & Optimization (and Applied Math) Club! We have many new events coming up in July, including talks from the following professors: Prof Lewis (C&O), Prof Horrocks (C&O), Prof. MacLeish (Statistics), Prof. Liu, and ProfBarragar (Pure Math). Topics and Room Numbers will be announced soon. Watch for posters across the MC for details!!!

On July 4th, 1995 the PMC is challenging professors to a Slo-pitch softball game. Be sure to come out and support the Pure Math Club in our hour of victory!!! (See... we have a secret weapon: confidence! Lots of confidence!). Look for postings in uw.math.ugrad for more information, or check the PMC door or the calendar in front of the Comfy Lounge for details. As always, Ultimate continues to be played Mondays and Thursdays at 4:00pm on the Village green. Come on out, and join in the fun!

Longstanding PMC members will note that the PMC office appearance has changed: for the better! This weekend marked the official term cleanup of the PMC, with donuts for all the contributors. Thanks go out to all the people who helped make the PMC a nice, clean, comfy place again!!!

For those of you interested in getting in on a new batch of PMC t-shirts, talk to Calvin Li. We'll try to make the colours different from those of the Winter term, we promise!

If you're interested in Pure Math, C&O, or Applied Math, drop by the PMC and say hello! Memberships are only $2.00, and new members are always welcome!

Come see us in the PMC!

Your friendly PMC news guy,
