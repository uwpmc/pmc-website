# PMC&OC Speaks!
## Okay, now we're on a roll
Our second talk of the term was this past Wednesday! Leon Hsu elucidated us all about matroids and what they can do for aspiring C&O students. So if you wanted to know what matroids were and didn't attend the talk, well... I guess you'll have to take more C&O courses, or something.

But that talk was just the beginning of a huge onrush of talks to come; expect at least one talk a week until the end of July! Next up to bat is Prof. Willward on June 30. At the time of the writing of this article I do not know what the topic will be, but posters should be up by the time this *math***NEWS** comes out, give or take a day.

The date for the softball game against the Profs has been set. Come on down to support the club on July 7, between 2:30 and 4:30 by Columbia lake, and help hand the profs a stinging defeat! Incidentally, the next co-rec game is the next day, Friday July 8, at 4:00 in Columbia lake field 5A. And I'm really, really going to try to get a schedule posted on the club door this week, but this information is also available in the newsgroup uw.pmc.

Finally, the PMC&OC is looking for a third exec member, to replace Tak who is now gainfully employed in Toronto. If you're interested in doing a few simple things for the club (help with postings, run for pop and doughnuts for the talks on occasion, be available on a semi-regular basis) email either me (`pmilley`) or Todd Parsons (`tlparsons`) and let us know. If we don't get a volunteer fairly soon, look for an impromptu election in the club's future.

Later, folks... I have a midterm to write!
