## "End of the Reign" Update
Yes, the term is coming to a slow end. This means my reign as Queen will soon be over. But before I relinquish my throne I would like to thank all of the speakers we had this term. In particular the last two which have gone unthanked in math**NEWS** so far: Jeff Shallit, the mathematical detective, gave an entertaining talk early in November, and George LaBahn brought us all a little closer to understanding MAPLE. Thank you both for the great talks!

Lastly, a reminder to ALL of the PMC&OC family of the Big Time End of Term Gala at Shot in the Dark on Monday. (I think that's the 5th). I hope to see you all there.
