# PMC&OC Speaks!
## Time flies when you're selling cookies...
The past two weeks have been busy, busy, busy!!! What has your friendly neighbourhood Pure Math and C&O Club been doing, I hear you ask? We've held a wildly successful bake sale, sold t-shirts, and played the last co-rec volleyball game of the term! Not to mention the entertaining talks by Professors Gilbert and Lewis. All this has happened since the last issue of math**NEWS**... are we dynamic and energetic or what?

Sadly, things are starting to slow down as yet another term winds to a close. Our next talk is on March 27th, so watch for posters. And as I implied earlier, co-rec sports are finished for the term. So you'll probably find PMC&OC members kicking back and relaxing in the club office (MC 3033, don't you know) and partaking of our fine collections of mathematical books and journals. And just think... we don't have to worry about finals for another whole week or so! Ah, peace.
