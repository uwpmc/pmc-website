## From our club to you
It's comming up, the Pentathlon, March 9th. We are going to beat the CSC in Chess, Go, Othello, Trivial Pursuit and Snow Soccer tournaments. We may need a few OOthello and Go players, so if you can play, drop by the PMC office.

Next the PMC will squash the CSC in... a Bake Off! Thats right. On Monday march 11 the PMC is going to prove that PMCers are better cookers.

After this there should be no doubt in your mind who the better mathies are.

Want to help direct frosh wannabes? On March the 15th the PMC is hosting a High School Math Day. Visiting high school students will get involved with codes and error correction on CD's, number theory, time travel theory, cryptology and code breaking, group decrypting as well as a problem solving contest. Sound interesting? Drop by the PMC if you want to get involved.

Speaking of high school, on the 28th the PMC got Stan Burris to hold a talk on "High School Identities." Very, very interesting. On Tuesday March 2 Jack Edmonds will be speaking, and on March 19 Katherine Hare will talk.

The Pure Math Club is organizing an Undergraduate Math Day at the University of Toronto. The day will be March 26. This is a joint effort between us, U of T and Western.

And in the ongoing department, every Thursday at 7:00 pm in MC4061 there's the problem solving group which discusses a variety of intersting math problems. Also every Sunday at 2:00pm in the Optometry parking lot the PMC plays ball hockey. So come on out stretch your brain and pull a few muscles.

For more information on anything drop by the PMC office.
