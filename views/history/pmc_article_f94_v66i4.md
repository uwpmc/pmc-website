# More Fun From The PMC&O Club
Another week has ended in the PMCOC empire. Ken Davidson spoke to what we are sure will be an enthusiastic crowd on the subject of connecting invertibles in infinite dimensional algebra. (Don't ask...) Within the next two weeks there will be talks on Symbolic Algebra and The Mathematical Detective: The history of Analysis of Algorithms. So be forewarned.
