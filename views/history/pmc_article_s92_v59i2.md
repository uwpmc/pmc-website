Hello hello hello! It's been a while... but now we're back! As reported in our last column, we indeed have held elections! And now, exclusive to *math***NEWS**, we'd like to present... Our Summer Executive!!!!

**President:** Wayne Liu (outfielder and volleyball hero)

**Vice President:** Steve Gamble (all-star second baseman)

**Secretary/Treasurer:** Kevin Takahashi (first baseman)

So far we have had two fabulous talks! Kathryn Hare gave us the lowdown on graduate studies in math, and Jonathan Borwein gave us the lowdown on Pi! Both talks were interesting and informative and we'd like to thank Profs. Hare and Borwein for giving them. We're still undecided about having a talk for next week (June 8-12), but look forward to Prof. William Gilbert's talk about fractals, June 17! Keep your eyes peeled for posters about upcoming talks!!!

On to other matters... by the time you read this our co-rec slo-pitch team, Ptak's Pterodactyls (formerly Tak's Tigers), is hopefully still undefeated! But these co-rec games mean nothing to us, as we train hard for the ultimate showdown: softball vs. the profs! We've lost the game two summers straight, but this year WE'RE READY! And, of course, the inter-club softball weekend/day/whatever, wherein we'll crush, err... enjoy playing against the other clubs! And then there's our co-rec volleyball team, the Wet Willies, a bunch of pure mathies and C&O types in search of the perfect spike! Aided by some tall people, some good players, and a little Stealth(TM) technology, we haven't been able to make fools of ourselves......... YET!

As far as administrative matters go, since we're a student chapter of the Mathematical Association of America, we can offer MAA memberships at a discount! Come on by the office, MC 3033, for further details. As a matter of fact, just come on by the office! Official office hours are at least from 11:30-1:30 MWF, 11:30-2:30TR - but you'll likely find people who can help you most of the day. So drop in, whether it be to join the club, just say hi, or to ask advice on things mathematical, musical or cinematic! We've also got lots of other really cool things planned for the summer including BBQs, perhaps a movie excursion or two, and the mother of all movie marathons - a 72-hour straight movie weekend! (run by yours truly, natch.)

Well, I'd include more, but I seem to be running out of time. And so ends another PMC&OC column... until the next issue of *math***NEWS**...

Be seeing you.
