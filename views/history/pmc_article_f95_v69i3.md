# PMC Meeting
## Believe it or not...
Yes, I know that this is an unusual measure, but I figured, what the hell, we might as well try this once.

The almost-official middle-of-term PMC meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, November 1st at 5:30, room to be announced. (Check the newsgroup - uw.pmc. If we never say, go to the office and we'll work from there.) Anyone who cares to come out is most welcome to.

Why are we having this meeting? Why, to discuss things, of course. Specifically, we want to talk about the prospective merger with the slightly defunct Applied Math Club, as well as events for the term and possible capital expenditures. (Ooh... big words for a mathie.)

Come one, come all...
