# PMC Loses Verbal Diarrhea
## LOOK! This column is less than a page long!
Hello again and welcome to a column called the PMC. This column is by and about the Pure Math Club.

On Monday the 18th the PMC is having a co-rec soccer game at Seagram Stadium. The game is at 9:45 pm. Drop by the PMC office for more info. Also, the PMC has challenged the CSC to a pentathalon of Chess, Go, Othello, Trivial Pursuit and Squash. However, the CSC had no (read: "Chickened out of") squash players so now soccer was substituted. The pentathalon is tentatively scheduled for March the 9th. Once again, go to the PMC office for more information.

Thanks to all people who participated in the PMC's valentine flower sale. Thanks to you the sale was a success.

On February the 28 the Pure Math Club presents a talk by Stan Burris in room MC 4058. Another talk will be held on March the 7th by Jack Edmonds. Thanks to John baker who spoke at the last PMC talk on "Characters in Mathematics"

The Problem Solving group is meeting every Thuursday (except during reading week) at 7:00 in room MC 4061
