## What's up for this term, eh?
Well... first thing's first. We had a wonderful little meeting on Wednesday (I hope) during which we elected our Summer Executive. I'd tell you who they are, but I guess I don't know yet. *math***NEWS** is kinda weird that way. Anyhow, we also planned lots of fun fun fun fun fun events for the summer. How do I kow? Well... I'll make sure that we do, or rather I will have made sure that I did. Huh? Writing for *math***NEWS** sure is temporally mind-boggling!

Anyhow, this summer, we will be playing Co-Rec Softball and Volleyball. If you want to play for us, drop by the office every so often to find out when the games are, or call one of the Captains &mdash; Mark Patchett (747-3525) and Kevin "Tak" Takahashi (747-9152). We are also planning a couple of games against the faculty and other clubs. Stay tuned for more information. One of my other plans is to get some beach volleyball going at the courts near Fed Hall.

Let's see... well... we are also going to have a BBQ or four this summer, along with a movie night or two. We are also planning all sorts of cool things that all you wonderful people suggested at the meeting we had on Wednesday. Of course, any other iideas you may have are more than welcome, they are well come. (That's me trying to sound like old Bill Shakespeare).

It's time for an update on last term's events. Life was kinda mellow here during the winter term. We'll blame it on a seasonal disorder. Anyhow, at our end of term meeting (which was a dandy, I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya!!) we decided that the Pure Math and C&O Club would never change its name so as to include the word "science" or any derivative thereof. Since most of you weren't around last term and missed the big stink about the Faculty name change you probably didn't find that too funny. Well... PTHHHHHT TO YOU!!

It seems the pizza has arrived so this column must end.
