Hi! Welcome to the second installment of the PMC column this year. I was going to continue the adventure column format, but I couldn't. The powers felt that it revealed too much information about the secrets of PMC. If you feel that U(W) just won't be the same without it, mail me at hrook@dahlia.

This column is much more functional, its in point form. At the end is an exciting new contest to challenge and amaze you. So, read on.
- Ball Hockey was played last Sunday in the Optometry parking lot. We're going to try to have it every week. It looks like we're going to have a game against the Profs. For more misinformation drop by the PMC office MC 3033.
- The Pure Math club will be selling a variety of flowers. Orders will be taken from Feb 1st to Feb 13. The actual flowers can be picked up on the 14th. PMC members get a discount!
- The omnipotent yet lovable leader of the PMC has problems solving puzzles like the Rubic's Cube. Also, English is not her first language. She's not sure what her mother tongue is.
- Colin, Paul, Wayne and ummmmmmm, oh yeah Bernie, who are the PMC foreign correspondents in Europe, have sent us postcards from Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Paris, Geneva and the Vatican. Rumour has it that Wayne got more than he bargained for in Amsterdam.
- Oh yeah, You'll be able to order the flowers every day from 1:30 to 3:30 and from 10:30 to 11:30 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
- This past Thursday we had a talk on the Fields Institute. It was cool. Possible tentative topics for future talks are, "How to play mind games with professors" and "How cartoons defy the laws of physics"

And now for the exciting contest. Below is a list of PMC celebs:
- Dee
- Our omnipotent yet lovable leader
- Blair
- The red haired guy who was a student of the week a while back
- Me
- Some random individual who just happened to walk into the room

And below is a list of popular news groups:
- sci.math
- sci.math.symbolic
- rec.arts.startrek
- rec.arts.erotica
- talk.bizarre

See how well you know the personality of the PMC'ers by matching their name up to their favourite news group. Some people have more than one favourite group. Mail your solutions to hrook@dahlia. The winner will get... the complete rules to microwave grape racing and a list of the top 10 bumper stickers on the U.S.S. Enterprise. Wow!

*This Just In...* In monday night's soccer game against E1 and E6, The PMC won! And we only had 5 people, no switch offs. On a sad note Leon broke his glasses again. No other major injuries were reported.
