# PMC&OC Happenings
Hey all... we had a terrific meeting on Tuesday and elected a new executive. They all seem energetic and ready to take The Club to new heights. We also discussed plans for this term as well as next. We've already had one tremendously successful BBQ. Kudos to Dean and Leon for volunteering their place.

Other stuff you should know about the PMC&OC:
- Our office is located in the clubs hallway, in MC 3033.
- We are not just for Pure Math and C&O students. We are for anyone who enjoys mathematics or enjoys people who enjoy mathematics.
- We are not just for undergraduates. We welcome any and all people who would like to become part of our organization.
- We have a vast library of books that all members have access to.

Coming up this term...

**Mathematics: A Historical Perspective** A series of talks sponsored jointly by the PMC&OC and the Faculty that will feature guest lecturers speaking about a particular field or person, with a historical bent.

**Flag Football and Soccer** Competitive league terms \(in the wimpiest divisions\)... if you are a closet Joe Montana or Pele, let us know! We still need more bodies.

**Volleyball** Unforunately, we were the 101st Co-Rec team, so this term we likely won't be playing volleyball, although we could play some beach volleyball at the Bomber sometime.

**Ultimate Frisbee** Actually there isn't a PMC&OC ultimate team or anything, but I like playing, so anyone else who does can drop me a line \(`lchsu@cayley`, 747-3525\) and I'll let you know where the games are.

**Talks** There won't be many talks this term, since you'll all be busy going to the excellent series on the history of mathhematics \(see above\). It would be great to have some student talks in between them.

**BBQs** We've already had one, hopefully the weather will permit more. Stay tuned for details.

**MOVIES** We sometimes have movie nights and such things... if you are interested, let us know.

**PARTIES** Occasionally there is a wild party during the term. Paul and Dan, our two great PARTY DUDES are away at Grad School, so we need to find a new victim \(er... host\).

**PUTNAM** The first PUTNAM meeting was Tuesday. There are practice sessions for both frosh and upper year students. Everyone is welcome to either. For times and locations of these sessions, check with Prof. Chris Small or Dorothy Chapman. Or you can drop by the Office and someone will know.

**OTHER STUFF** We are always open to new and exciting ideas, so let us know if you have any.

Well, that's all for me...
