Well, well, well...

Yes, it's once again time for your friendly neighbourhood PMC update.

Yes, herein will at least be revealed what Cayley said to Cauchy after Cantor told them that arbitrary A and B were off intersecting in the bushes while Sylow groupies were demonstrating against the increase in increasing functions with negative derivatives almost nowhere, but at the same time Madge was heard to say "you're soaking in it", referring of course to the now (in)famous theorem of Jumpin' Jack Flash to the effect that his condensation points were dripping into his open sets and flooding our beloved club office.

Yes, all this and less, right here in front of your very own face.

First of all, talks. Professor Tenti spoke yesterday on the connections between mathematics and the natural sciences. I can't give you more details as I haven't been there yet. Our next talk is on Monday, Oct. 28 at 4:30pm in MC 4062. Professor Ravi from stats will be giving a talk. You may know him from his frequent contributions to a certain *math***NEWS** column, which I shall Leave unmentioned. Please note the time change. That is for this talk only, we will try and stick to Thursday afternoon. Professors Wagner and Dickey will be giving talks on November 7 and 14, respectively. Doughnaughts and pop will be available, as per usual.

I can't give you any more details on upcoming social events, as they have not yet been finalized. We are sitll taking movie requests for our movie weekend, to be scheduled soon. In sports, we won our last football game on Thursday. Yes, we have a football team, and we actually won. Hey, I'm impressed. Our next and last volleyball game will be on all hallow's eve. Yes, the 31st. We plan to win, and furthermore we plan to do so dressed in 15th century period costume. Well, maybe not. But come out and cheer us on anyway. And furthermore, we issue an open challenge to any other club: we will take you on in the game of your choice. preferably circular-saw-blade frisbee on the sixth floor (to the death), but we'll accept any other sport as well.

On an administrative level, you might want to know that the PMC club is now officially the Pure Math and C&O club. In fact, I'll go and change the title of this article right now. This raises the question: do we therefore need a second mascot? To solve this problem, I will declare a contest. Do we nee another mascot, and if so, who should it be? I will personally buy one lunch at the C+D (sub and a drink) for whoever submits the best answer. Leave answers at the office (MC3033) marked "attention: promotions officer". Submissions must pass minimum criterion standards as defined by P.H. (writing "bob" is not a valid answer). Contest not open to employees of General Dynamics or any other yicky mega-corporations. Only members are eligible to receive the grand prize. Memberships are of course available for a mere one dollar from our office (MC3033). Anything exalting the eternal glory of pure math, c&o, or Bert will earn you bonus marks.
