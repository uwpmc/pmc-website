## the Next Generation
And the vicious circle starts again...

Welcome! The Pure Math Club is off to a flying start, with this summer's executive in Paris, France and half of this term's executive recently returned from Hungary. Executive elections took place last Friday, with results as follows:

President: Sharon Fournier (subject to successful registration)

Vice Pres: Wayne Liu

Secretary/Treasurer: Nikhil Shah & Colin Springer

Many thanks to all those who came out and voted!

We also held our organizational meeting recently. If you missed it, and wish to become involved, don't panic! Drop by our office (MC 3033) during office hours (which are currently undetermined, but usually center around the lunch-hour) and join up! For the low fee of $1, you become a member, and are thus entitled to all membership benefits (membership has its privileges...).

The PMC has formed a student chapter of the Mathematical Association of America, which entitles members to vastly reduced prices on MAA journals, including the American Mathematical Monthly, and on MAA books. If you're interested, be sure to drop by our office for more information on how to join.

While we're discussing the lofty reaches of mathematics, the Putnam competition is coming soon, and the PMC has an uncountable (you try to count them!) supply of problems to help you prepare. Once again, drop by our office, and see if you can baffle the office-workers with some! Of course, the Putnam coaching sessions are held weekly at 7:00 PM in MC 6091A, with freshman meetings on Tuesday, and upper year meetings on Mondays. Small but tasty refreshments are served, if you can beat Colin to them!

As usual, we'll be having weekly talks this term, every Thursday between 12 and 1 (subject to room booking). Of course, pop and doughnuts are free at all talks. You may have missed it, but yesterday the squad from Budapest gave a talk about the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics, a lively and witty discourse which was enjoyed by all. Nagyon szepen koszonom!

As far as extra-curricular social-type activities are concerned, we'll be having some fun now, my oh my. There will be a club BBQ sometime later this term. We're also organizing a joint UW / U of T Math Day in Toronto. Plans are underway for a movie marathon weekend, as well as the odd field trip to the odd movie theatre... Of course, there will be the usual end-of-term Christmas party in conjunction wit hthe other clubs, as well as lots of other fun stuff to be determined later.

The PMC has formed a volleyball team, which lost its first game (but a great time was had by all... and it was an outstanding first practice, too!) We're ready and willing to take on any club at anything, at any time. Let us know, and we'll pencil you in! We've also got a football team, which kicks butt!! 9yeah, yeah... wee lost our first game... so what? We took pity on the other team! Yeah, that's it!)

You can reach the PMC by either dropping by our office (MC 3033), calling us (x6139), e-mailing us (pmclub@watserv1) or just showing up at an event (look out for our signs!). So come on out, and enjoy a great term! We're looking forward to seeing you out at our events.
