# PMC&OC Weekend Update
## I'm not Chevy Chase, and most likely you aren't either.
It's been a while, and a busy while at that!

We've had 3, count 'em THREE, talks since you'vel ast read this column. Ravi Vakil spoke on Beatty's Theorem, Complementary Sequences and Wythoff's Game. Prof. Will Gilbert spoke on fractals, and Prof. naomi Nishimura spoke about parallel computation! We'd like to thank our speakers for their interesting and informative lectures.

Batman Returned on June 19... big deal. BECAUSE.... in late July... PAUL CHECK RETURNS!!! And not with just any talk, either! Paul Returns with The Mother Of All Talks! But seriously... Paul's talk will span 3 hour-long lectures, culminating in a discussion of Lie algebra (the first 2 hours being background material). Other upcoming speakers include Prof. Kathryn Hare, Marc Ordower, Prof. Marston Conder, and a few others that (unfortunately) slip my mind right now. Keep your eyes peeled for signs, or drop by the office for further details. Let's see... what else is there? Oh yeah! The Pterodactyls are still kicking co-rec butt, as usual, while we prepare for the ultimate test (even more ultimate than midterms and finals together!) - the game against the PROFS! The July date is still in the air, so drop by the office (MC 3033), give us a call (x6139) or send us some mail (pmclub watserv1) if you're curious or not a member (shame on you!). Speaking of softball, on June 10, a proper subset of the PMC&OC played softball with a proper subset of the high school students up for the Seminar. I'd like to thank everyone who came out to the game on such short notice... a good time was had by all. And our volleyball team, the Wet Willies, are still spiking away, and now we've got a goal - preparing for the Math Faculty Intramural Volleyball Tourney Thingy.

The 72-hour "Mother Of All Marathons" Movie Marathon Weekend Thingy is still in its planning stages - anybody with requests can drop 'em off at the PMC&OC Office (MC 3033). Both of the informal BYOBBBQs we've had have been gangs of fun, and while we'll probably have a couple more across the term, we'll probably organize the "Mother Of All BBQs" sometime in July, too. (By the wya, if any of these things sound interesting, volunteers are MORE than welcome...).

Well, that's about all the time that I have right now (midterms, you know), so I'll stop now. But if you're curious about anything, stop by the office and we'll try to enlighten you (or confuse you (or both)).

Later!
