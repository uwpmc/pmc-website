# PMC
This is by way of an introduction to the PMC (aka pure math club). We're just getting started this term, and we've got lots of stuff planned. Our interpid leader, Shapiro, has announced the imminent creation of the dreaded PMC soccer team, who will set forth to challenge all those foolhardy enough to doubt their bravado. Furthermore, our bold chief of mission control, O'toole, is preparing a dazzling array of guest speakers, ranging from our very own Dr. Horton, speaking on the wonders of the torus, to Dr. Ruth, speaking on, ... well, ... other wonders.

We're fast accumulating one of the largest libraries of pure math material, we've just acquired some modern computer equipment, we've got a new logo, and we've got a column in *math***NEWS**! And for only (an undetermined sum) yyou too can become a member of this illustrious assemblage. But I hear doubt, hestitation, reluctance even. Why should I become a member? (you say) What the hell do I get? (you say) Well here's where your money goes: straight into the pockets of the PMC executive. But what the hell, buy a membership anyway.

We'll be having (as you read this: will have had) an organisational meeting on Wednesday (last week). If you want, or even if you don't want, drop by and buy a membership, have a chat, make a contribution to the above mentioned PMC exec fund.
