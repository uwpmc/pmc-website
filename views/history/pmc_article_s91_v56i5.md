Well, loyal followers... we have once again completed another successful term. Our talks are done. Our social events have ended. And by the time you read this, our highly esteemed and worshipped executive committee will have already blown the rest of the budget on alcohol and similar substances. Our latest events have included:
- A totally awesome talk on cryptography.
- Our butt-kicking of the AMC, CSC and Asci Sci Club in a free-for-all tournament last Saturday, July 20th. An awesome time was had by all. We declare ourselves the champs... although different opinions may exist.
- The PMC vs. PM profs and grad students was a really good game. Our score was closer to zero than their's was... so I don't know what that means. Our exec will re-evaluate the results and publish a report on their findings. Congratulations to the profs and grad students for struggling so hard.
- President Carmen Young's birthday on August 8th. She's going to Paris, France for a year and she will be sorely missed. 'foodles, Carmen!

Coming up next term we have:
- Executive elections sometime in September.
- A talk by Paul Check (one of the cool PMC members) on some bizarre topic related to something he did this summer. I forget what.
- The return of the dudes from Budapest and course the return of Sharon Fournier from (the wastelands of) Sudbury. That's a joke! I love Sudbury!
- DON'T MISS OUR ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING IN EARLY SEPTEMBER!

Have a good work term for those of you going on co-op, and I'll see everyone else in the fall. Be nice to frosh, eh!
