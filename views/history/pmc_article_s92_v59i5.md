# PMC&OC Weekend Update
## Still news to me...
Well, another term is over and here I am, writing the last Weekend Update column for another summer '92 as your Secretary/Treasurer. Ah well, enough of the melancholy stuff... on to news!

First and foremost : On Thursday, July 23, the Pterodactyls broke a 2 game losing streak and the PMC&OC beat the profs 24-21 in a thrilling game! This victory avenges our previous two losses in this annual event &mdash; our next goal is to be above .500!!! Thanks to the profs and others who came out to play against us, and thanks to all the Pterodactyls who came out, too!

We've had more talks since you last read this column (no kidding!). Paul Check talked about Lie Algebras and Prof. Jellrey Shallit talked about the Towers of Hanoi. Also, Prof. Kathryn Hare gave us a talk about Sets of Uniqueness that I forgot to mention last issue.

The PMC&OC would like to thank all of those who gave us lectures this term, for sharing their time and knowledge with us. We'd also like to thank those of you who came out to one or more of our talks. Attendance was always more than Wayne expected, and the rooms were usually full (and we usually ran out of donuts, too!).

We'd also like to thank those members who came out for more than just talks, i.e. BYOBBBQs, co-rec sports, etc. And I must say, I was very impressed by the number of frosh who came out this term! Good form! (oops... just saw HOOK again this weekend...) I hope that you'll stick around and be there to run the club once we're off doing whatever! Just remember - this is the PMC&OC's kick-butt stream!!!

As most of you know, THE MOTHER OF ALL END-OF-TERM BQQ'S IS TODAY!!!!!!!!!! If you didn't know, it's probably because you weren't on our mailing list (trust me - those who were got PLENTY of mail about it). Meet at 4:30 p.m. in the DC Fishbowl!!! We're also going to hold the end-of-term meeting at this time, so please BE THERE! I only expect this to last about 20 minutes, and the sooner it's over, the sooner we eat!!!!!!!!!!

Well, I suppose that's about all there is to say. Good luck on your finals. On behalf of your executive : President Wayne Liu and Vice-President Steve Gamble, and yours truly : have a good work/school term, and we'll see you come the winter! That's the term, folks, and I am outta here!!!!!
