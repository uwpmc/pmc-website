Well, our talk on Group Analysis of Differential Equations was an unqualified success. Those who missed it still regret the emptiness in their lives that could have been filled by the exciting, enlightening, and envigorating series of talks presented by the Applied Math Club. Well, okay, it was only a talk, and there was a bit of a snafu with the rooms, but hey, the best is yet to come.

Yesterday we had to psuedo-annual Applied Math barbecue. If you missed it don't worry, we are having a joint Coffee and Tea party with the Pure Math Club on Thursday July 27 at 3:30pm in MC5136. Come on out and enjoy copious cups of Columbian coffee, along with the fabulous fudge and other fresh fodder, as well as the chance to chat with numerous interesting professors and students.

We will be having one more talk this term, on Thursday July 20th from 2:30pm to 3:30pm in MC4042. Professor Paldus will be talking on a topic in Quantum Mechanics. Watch the walls for further details.
