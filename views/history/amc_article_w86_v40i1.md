# Applied Math Club [STYLISED]
Some of you may recall and Applied Math barbeque which was held last summer (the day before the AM 381 midterm). The success of that event prompted its organisers to form the Applied Math Club.

The club ran a number of events during the Fall term, including a seminar on compact disc technology and an exotic coffee and tea party.

In the next four months the Applied Math Club is planning more opportunities for applied math faculty and students to socialise as well as more seminars, which, though applied math oriented, will be of interest to students of all mathematic disciplines.

Upcoming events include a coffee and tea party on January 30th. Applied Math sweatshirts will also be available soon.

To become a member of the club and partake of free coffee, tea and snacks, come out to any club event or visit the AM club office in MC5168. Membership is only 50c, probably the best 50c you'll spend in this building (even better than green muffins). You don't even have to be in applied math to be a member &mdash; you don't even have to be in math!
