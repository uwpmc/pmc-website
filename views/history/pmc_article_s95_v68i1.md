## The PMC is on the march
Summertime... And the living is easy...

Well, we like to think so, at least. It's a new term, lads and lasses, and we of the PMC aren't taking it lying down. For one thing, our plans for world domination have come one step closer to fruition, as we have amalgamated the sometime AMC (Applied Math Club) into our collective. Yeah! Wow! Great stuff!

In keeping with this, our new God-Emperor Max I hhas been rounded up speakers for this term from all three departments in which we hold sway. We plan to have at least eight speakers this term, and as always, free sugary-type refreshments will be available to anyone who comes out.

We are also sponsoring a broomball and a slo-pitch team this term (watch for the hopefully-upcoming annual prof-PMC softball game). As well, since campus rec isn't supporting Ultimate this term, we are. Games will probably be every Wednesday at the Village Green. Come one, come all!

Keep watching for other events. If you have any foolish questions, feel free to bother God-Emperor Max Stevens, Dread Minister Calvin Li, or General Secretary Matt Walsh with them. Up the reovlution!
