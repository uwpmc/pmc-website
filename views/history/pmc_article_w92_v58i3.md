here's the latest from your friendly neighbourhood spider-club. Well, in the realm of talks, we had one last Thursday, given by Robert Ravenscroft, discussing Maple and how it works. Marks in first year calculus and algebra reportedly hit a record high this week. Previous to the above, Prof. Djokovic discussed permutations and quadratic reciprocity. It was also well received by all onlookers. Bill Martin, of C&O 230 fame, will have given a talk on Thursday (February 13) revolving around our old friend, the icosohedron. We will not, as you may have guessed, be having a talk next week because it is reading week and we'll all be in Bermuda. Well, some sort of approximation to Bermuda.

On le jour du Saint Valentin we will be having a soccer game, at 6:25 pm. Note that that is today, as you are reading this. So come on out if you are interested in playing for the once and future mighty PMCOC. The soccer game, as per the norm this time of year, will be held indoors at Seagram's Stadium. We would also like to issue an open challenge to any other club to a contest of utter supremacy in the realm of......... road hockey. This is a real live challenge, and we will take on anyone, at any time.

There is not a whole lot else to relate, other than a vague curiosity as to whether anyone will notice an aardvark if I say it very softly. The imminent release of MGM's "The Adventures of Bert" as plugged in the last column, has unfortunately been delayed due to lack of funding, and sundry problems relating to objections on the part of certain executive members to their taxidermic fate. Thank you, and good night.
