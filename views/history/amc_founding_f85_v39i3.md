# Applied Math Club
Until now, sophisticated and unsophisticated Applied Math students and other students didn't have the kind of club they have been looking for. They wanted to join a club but they couldn't find one that was just right. That is until now....

A new club has landed! This term heralds the start of the Applied Math Club and like the inventor of television, we know it's going to be big (and it won't offend your intelligence).

Events are gushing out of the brains of the club executives. Just to begin with a blast, the Applied Math Club ran the Applied Math Coffee and Tea Party.

The party began with Professor J. Wainwright discussing NSERC summer research jobs and the wonderful world of graduate work. The multitude of questions which followed indicated a sincere interest in this topic on the part of your fellow mathies. In the future, you can expect more important and informative seminars and meetings on other topics of interest to applied math students.

Following the discussion, home-baked munchies and different varieties of coffee and tea were brought forth, tasting all the better in the Graduate Student Lounge. Everyone enjoyed the opportunity to meet other people in Applied Math, and to talk about everything from applied math to co-op jobs and various and sundry other unrelated topics.

What will be next? Join the Applied Math Club and find out. It's guaranteed to be a great time and the best 50 cents you'll spend in this building (better than green muffins).

So how can you join? Just come out to any Applied Math Club event, or sign up whenever you find someone in the Applied Math Club office, MC 5168. That's M-C-5-1-6-8. Don't delay, join today.
