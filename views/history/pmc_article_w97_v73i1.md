# Report from the PMAMC&OC

We're off to a successful start, with the following executive having been elected:
<br></br>

**President:** Russell O'Connor

**Vice-President:** Nikita Borisov

**Treasurer/Secretary:** Duane Mattos
<br></br>

The first thing this new administration is doing is answering the numerous requests for new T-shirts with a question: what would you like to see on them? We are holding a contest for a new design; submissions will be accepted until January 27, 1997, at which point we will make an arbitrary decision. The winner gets a *free T-shirt* and, more importantly, eternal fame. If you have a logo for us, please contact one of the exec.

And now, news from the prime number department. The previous candidate for *Largest Prime*, \\(2^{1257787}-1\\), has been displaced! On November 13, 1996, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (**GIMPS**) yielded the new champion, \\(2^{1398269}-1\\). For the curious ones who want to know what it looks like, you'll be able to find its full expansion in the following bases on the walls of our office: \\(2\\), \\(10\\), \\(11\\), \\(16\\), and \\(2^{1398269}-1\\).

Finally, if you have not become a member of the club yet, you should join immediately! The benefits are uncountable (and yet can all be expressed in the English language!), but they include cheaper pop and juice prices &mdash; 35 and 40 cents respectively versus the non-member prices of 50 and 60 cents, the use of our extensive library, our not-so-extensive couch space, and general social recognition.

P.S. Remember, it's written \\(\(\\{PM,AM,C\\&O\\},C\)\\), but pronounced **P-M-C**!
