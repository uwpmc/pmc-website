## bert rules, bart drools
Hi there! this is your friendly neighbourhood PMC columnist back again for another fun-filled installment. First of all, a bunch of official-sounding stuff. Skip a few paragraphs down (up, sideways, turn the page, whatever) if you don't want to hear about it, if you're bored, or if you're a gelatinous slug, or whatever.

We have a tentative date set for the PMC pizza lunch: October 17th. members will get a discounted rate, that will even exceed the mere one dollar a membership will cost you. Speaking of memberships, they are still available at the PMC office (MC 3033), and will be until October 12. Office hours are closely approximated by the function oh(t)=1:30-14:30, but this is not taken as a deterministic statement, rather as a local maximum of the instantaneous probability of there being some form of life present and nominally functional. While you're picking up your membership, why not try on an official PMC t-shirt? It's made of the highest quality cotton/polyester fabric, with a multi-color logo on the front, and another on the back! And at only 16 dollars, it's the best fashion bargain you're likely to find ANYWHERE on the third floor of MC within ten meters of the CSC.

Our first talk of the term will be on October 3: Prof. John Baker, speaking on "Plane Curves, Polar Co-ordinates, and Winding Numbers". As usual, the PMC lecturer-in-residence, Dr. T. Horton, will be serving examples of some of his favourite torii. Any undergrads, grads, or faculty interested in giving a talk this term, we want to hear from you. Or if you have someone else you'd like to see give a talk, let us know. If you can't come by during our office hours, we have an email address now: pmclub@watserv1. We're also having a problem solving contest this term. Copies of the problems may be found on The Door, and you can get a copy from the people imprisoned behind said door, um, I mean, staffing the PMC office. Winners will be announced in the next PMC column, and there will perhaps be glorious prizes to be won as well, and it is possible that they may be fabulously valuable, too. We've got a rapidly growing library of math books, which you can drop by and have a peet at it, before it grows legs and tentacles and comes to take a peek at YOU. And we'll be subscribing to *Crux Mathematicorum and Mathematical Mayhem* this term too.

OK, that's it for the official sounding stuff. Now, here's the important part. We have a new mascot: bert. He's cute and cuddly and we all love him so. Furthermore, we, the PMC, do openly challenge the CSC, AMC, faculty teams, or any other grouping of people, random or otherwise, to a game of: anything. That's right, anything. You name it: soccer, baseball, volleyball, checkers, tiddlywinks, othello... A faculty spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity, has claimed faculty supremacy in the field of baseball and sundry other activities, but we're not so sure. Students may remember the crushing defeat of the CSC at our hands last summer. With the help of our new mascot, we think we can do it again. Are you, (insert your name), ready to accept our challenge?

Apologies to anyone who feels that they have sufferred any inconvenience, grievance or discomfort, as a result, direct, indorect, or otherwise, of this article and/or any associated materials that may be related or encompassed by the same, and are due such.
