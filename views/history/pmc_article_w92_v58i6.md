# Pure Math and C&O Club Stuff
Hello, hello. We had our End of Term General Meeting last week and attendance was phenomenal. Well, all right, it wasn't phenomenal, but it was pretty good. We had 14 members show up, as well as two unidentified people who came in, took a donut and pop and left. They were probably MathSoc goons.

A motion by Paul Check to censure Eric Sutherland, our great and wonderful Secretary/Treasurer, for not attending the meeting and being overly associated with mathSoc, was passed unanimously. This was the first time in our history that we have successfully passed a motion to censure. Congratulations Eric!!

Another motion by Paul Check was passed. (He's a busy boy, eh?) This was also passed unanimously. The Pure Math and C&O Club is no longer officially annoyed at MathSoc and accepts as an axiom its existence. No one is sure how we were previously annoyed at them without their existence. Probably the work of stark mad empiricists. Of course, since the existence of MathSoc is an axiom, there is no longer any need to believe that they really exist. It is hoped that no one will falsely conclude that since MathSoc exists, they must think.

Ever since the rumours of a Faculty name change, there has been a push from extreme right wing elements of our club to change its name to the Purely Mathematical Sciences and Combinatorially Optimal Sciences Club. In an attempt to silence these fiendish fellows, we passed a motion from Blair Madore, a suspected cohort of Paul Check's. As usual, it was passed unanimously. (Is someone influencing the voting in the Club or what?) Henceforth, the PMC&OC shall not change its name so as to include the word "science" or any derivative thereof. How do we know it's differentiable anyways?

These same right wing elements have also been lobbying for a new name for the Office. What kind of name is "Left-Angled Cafe?, anyways? Well, this time the possibility of a name change sparked a number of suggestions for possible new names. Among them were "The Stoned Weierstrass Windowless Cafe", "The PMC&OCP+D", "MC 2065 & 2066" and "The Compact Space". After not so much discussion and a number of close ballots, "MC 2065 & 2066" was selected as the new name for our office. It is hoped that this new name will attract (confuse?) more frosh.

That leaves us with the important business that was discussed. A series of historical talks are being planned for next year. Upon hearing that it would take more than a minute or two to cover a given Mathematician, Paul remarked that his life must be pretty boring. At that point a number of people put up their hands, obviously thinking that this was a motion we were voting on.

Also, we are planning on becoming more involved in the MAA. We are a student chapter, and members can become student members of thhe MAA and receive a number of excellent magazines at incredible discounts (up to 90% off). There are also conferences in all sorts of exotic locations (Miami University, Oxford, Ohio) to which we are planning on sending representatives.

That's pretty much it for this term, so a good summer to you all and a good life to those of you who are leaving us. If you are going to be around in the summer, look for posters about the organisational meeting, or just drop by MC 2065 & 2066, our office, to visit and read the postcards I'll send from Gay Paris.
